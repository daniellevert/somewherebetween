Title: Somewhere Between Connection & Disconnection

Created by: Daniel LeVert

Created for: ART 151 Course

This project is meant to explore the dichotomy of life during the 21st century global pandemic caused 
by the COVID-19 outbreak. The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed the lives of billions around 
the world overnight. With non-essential businesses closing their doors as people work, learn, and 
live from home to the new sight of people wearing masks in public everyday. This phenomenon not only 
showed us just how connected humans are to each other and their ecosystem but also the ways in which 
we remain disconnected. The pandemic is showing us the complexity of self-isolating to stop the 
spread of the disease which opposes the natural human desire to socialize and make meaning of 
life through work. Throughout this pandemic we continue to see times in which humans and their 
environment are very closely connected and integrated. On the other hand we have seen disconnection 
in conflicts that have arisen politically. Ultimately this experience is shared whether it’s 
demonstrating to us just how truly connected we are in some ways through our humanity or just how 
disconnected we are now and how disconnected we were before all of this as we begin to see the true 
inadequacies of technologies in keeping real bonds as we move towards a more technological future.

The user is invited to perform with this digital performance art installation. Clicking to create a
connection that is finite or to change the text on screen. In addition the user can click and drag on
the interface to change the mood of their self-isolation. All of these interactions can occur while a
one-way livestream reflects back to the user how they look experiencing "self-isolation."

This was originally performed with a spoken word piece and live music loop by Daniel LeVert. Audio of 
a recorded version of this performance is supported in some browsers. Find original spoken word text below.
